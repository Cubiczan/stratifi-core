## What this is

As organizations deploy multiple specialized AI agents (a finance agent, a strategy agent, a compliance agent, …), they hit three predictable failures:

1. **Context fragmentation** — each agent sees a different slice of the organization
2. **Reasoning opacity** — humans get a conclusion without seeing how it was reached
3. **Output drift** — agents produce prose; humans need something runnable

Consensus Hardening Protocol composes five well-specified subsystems to solve all three:

| Subsystem | Role | Spec it implements |
|---|---|---|
| **Consensus Hardening Protocol** | Cross-model decision hardening with gates, packets, lock states, adversarial foundation attack, VCL diagnosis, and third-party validation | `cme.chp` |
| **Cognitive Mesh Protocol** | Structured expansion ↔ compression reasoning with grounding checks | `cognitive-mesh-protocol.skill` |
| **Context Engineering Framework** | Layered short/long-term memory + entity/event/task schema | `context-engineering-framework.skill` |
| **Agentic Context Engineering** | Evolving playbooks with Generator/Reflector/Curator, delta-only updates | `agentic-context-engineering.skill` |
| *Statement & workflow synthesizer* | Turns multi-agent output into a vivid problem statement + executable workflow | *(bundled)* |

Together they form a hardened decision system: every agent reads from and writes to shared context, reasons visibly, and improves its operating playbook over time.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zan-maker/consensus-hardening-protocol.git
cd consensus-hardening-protocol
pip install -e .
cme demo
```

Or without installing:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cme.cli demo
```

Both produce a full Markdown orchestration report: problem classification, per-agent reasoning traces, grounding verdicts, playbook deltas, and a final executable workflow.

## Consensus Hardening Protocol

CHP is the decision-governance layer for origin-agnostic, cross-model finance workflows. It is designed for high-stakes CFO decisions where a single model answer is not good enough: the system records the foundation, attacks it, packages it for a partner model, requires echoed payload integrity, and prevents final lock until third-party validation.

The current implementation covers:

- pre-session context checks with duplicate halt and related-lock auto-population
- model parity checks that halt on significant asymmetry
- R0 gate and foundation score gate before packet generation
- adversarial foundation disclosure and foundation attack
- Phase 0 devil's advocate capture and Round 3 implementation devil's advocate support
- VCL diagnosis in the origin packet
- `BEGIN_PAYLOAD` / `END_PAYLOAD` packet envelopes with required `PAYLOAD_ECHO`
- structured `STATE_SNAPSHOT` persistence
- Phase 1 gate enforcement before implementation rounds
- Round 5 `PROVISIONAL -> UNRESOLVED` forcing
- `PROVISIONAL_LOCK -> LOCKED` progression only after third-party validation

The core state model lives in [`src/cme/chp`](src/cme/chp). The CFO operating layer that uses it with finance, strategy, and compliance agents lives in [`src/cme/cfo_os`](src/cme/cfo_os).

Current remaining protocol work:

- exact partner 7-section parser/enforcer
- council spawn execution for high-stakes low-confidence sessions
- final convergence closure with URLs, blind-spot final audit, and structural-vulnerability final audit

Quick run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cme.cli chp-start \
  --title "Fund enterprise workflow" \
  --company "Acme" \
  --problem "Should we fund a new enterprise workflow team this quarter?" \
  --amount 2500000 \
  --payback-months 14 \
  --min-runway 12 \
  --current-runway 18
```

Full demo package:

- [CHP_DEMO_VIDEO.md](CHP_DEMO_VIDEO.md)
- [docs/CHP_FINANCE_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md](docs/CHP_FINANCE_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md)
- [examples/chp_demo_video.sh](examples/chp_demo_video.sh)
- [examples/chp_demo_partner_packet.txt](examples/chp_demo_partner_packet.txt)
- [RELEASE_NOTES_CHP.md](RELEASE_NOTES_CHP.md)
- [docs/media/README.md](docs/media/README.md)

This flow shows a decision moving from session start to partner packet ingestion to third-party validation and final lock.

Once recorded, the intended video path is:

Current CHP CLI commands:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cme.cli chp-start
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cme.cli chp-receive
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m cme.cli chp-validate
```

## CFO Workflow Suite

CHP now ships with a CFO workflow suite. Each workflow creates a finance artifact and attaches a CHP session so the output is auditable before it becomes a decision record.

| Workflow | CLI command | Output artifacts |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly CFO Variance Studio | `variance-studio` | Markdown, JSON, HTML |
| 13-Week Cash Forecast Engine | `cash-forecast-13w` | Markdown, JSON, Excel workbook |
| 24-Month SaaS Operating Model | `saas-model-24m` | Markdown, JSON, Excel workbook |
| Board Reporting Generator | `board-reporting-generator` | Markdown, JSON, PowerPoint deck |
| AP Cash & Payables Optimizer | `ap-optimizer` | Markdown, JSON, Excel workbook |
| CFO Decision Impact Simulator | `decision-impact-simulator` | Markdown, JSON, HTML |
| SaaS KPI Dashboard | `saas-kpi-dashboard` | Markdown, JSON, HTML, Excel workbook |
| Investment Committee Scoring Tool | `investment-committee` | Markdown, JSON, Excel workbook |
| Multi-Agent CFO Operating System | `cfo-os` | CFO session report with mesh trace, audit trail, and CHP state |

The finance roadmap is documented in [docs/CHP_FINANCE_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md](docs/CHP_FINANCE_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md).

## The 90-second demo

```bash
cme demo "Should we invest $4M in a new enterprise tier next quarter, \
          or extend SMB to cover enterprise use cases?"
```

What you'll see:

1. **Finance agent** runs first (no upstream dependencies). Expansion cycle across 6 steps — reframe, constraints, alternatives, assumptions, edge cases, cross-domain analogy — then compresses to `phased spend, 60/40 gated, 14-month payback`. Playbook gains a rule.
2. **Strategy agent** reads finance's recommendation from shared context automatically. Recommends `core anchor + 15% adjacent-market experiment`, flags what would falsify it. Existing playbook bullet gets marked `helpful`.
3. **Compliance agent** reads both upstream recommendations, produces `conditional approval` with DPIA + SCC + gated review tied to the finance milestone.
4. The synthesizer produces:
   - A **Statement** with 5 Whys, consequences across strategic/cultural/financial axes, and a strategic connection
   - An **executable Workflow** of 3 typed steps with correctly inferred `depends_on` ordering (topologically sorted from the agents' `produces`/`consumes` capabilities)

Every claim in the report traces back to an agent's expansion step, which traces back to a shared-context entity.

See [`DEMO_SCRIPT.md`](DEMO_SCRIPT.md) for the full walkthrough, recommended talking points, and expected output.

### Cognitive Mesh Protocol (`cme.protocol`)

Every agent turn runs through a visible breathing cycle:

- **Expansion** (up to 6 steps): Reframe → Constraints → Alternatives → Assumptions → Edge cases → Cross-domain analogy. Each step can carry explicit `uncertainty_flags`.
- **Compression** (1–2 steps): Integrate → Commit.
- **Grounding check**: every claim is tagged `verified | inferred | pattern-match` with a confidence level. A `detect_hallucination_risk` heuristic flags unsourced authority phrases ("studies show …") and bare percentages.
- **Failure-mode detection**: `FOSSIL_STATE` (repetition), `CHAOS_STATE` (expansion without compression), `HALLUCINATION_RISK` (≥3 ungrounded claims).
- **Adaptive classification**: strategic / analytical / creative / technical — auto-detected from the problem text, calibrates cycle depth.

### Context Engine (`cme.context`)

Implements the Context Engineering Framework:

- **Layered memory**: short-term with TTL + temporal weighting, auto-promotion to long-term based on importance + access frequency.
- **Fixed-schema self-baking**: `Entity { id, type, attributes }` / `Event { timestamp, actor, action, object }` / `Task { id, goal, subtasks, owner }`.
- **Context selection** by combined score (semantic relevance 50% + recency 20% + importance 20% + frequency 10%), with ≥0.85 cosine dedup.
- **Structured messages** for inter-agent sharing — each agent receives a `snapshot_for(agent_name, query)` packet containing the entities, recent events, active tasks, and top-k relevant notes.
- Thread-safe so agents can run concurrently.

No embedding model dependency — uses deterministic lexical cosine so the demo runs offline. Swap `_score_relevance` for a real embedding call in production.

### Agentic Context Engineering (`cme.playbook`)

Each agent owns a **playbook**, not a prompt:

- Bullets are `{id, section, content, helpful, harmful}`
- Six sections: `strategies_and_hard_rules`, `useful_code_snippets`, `troubleshooting_and_pitfalls`, `apis_to_use_for_specific_information`, `verification_checklist`, `domain_concepts`
- **Delta-only updates**: `ADD`, `INCREMENT`, `MERGE`, `PRUNE`. Full regeneration is impossible by design — this is how ACE prevents context collapse.
- **Reflector** analyzes each turn's trajectory + outcome + grounding issues → insights
- **Curator** transforms insights into deltas (never full rewrites)
- **Refinement pass** prunes low-utility bullets (`helpful/(helpful+harmful) < 0.4` after 3 samples) and dedupes by cosine similarity

The demo seeds each agent's playbook with 3 starter bullets per domain and extends it on every turn.

### Statement & workflow synthesizer (`cme.bridge`)

After every agent has contributed, the synthesizer produces:

1. A **Statement** with an entry point (problem / opportunity / situation), observable tension, 5 Whys derived from each agent's reframe step, consequences (strategic / cultural / financial) with a timeline, and a strategic connection to the organization's mission.
2. A **Workflow**: each agent's recommendation becomes a typed `WorkflowStep` with `inputs` / `outputs` / `depends_on`. Dependency inference is automatic — steps that consume `budget_envelope` are ordered after the step that produces it.
3. A **completeness report** for the statement against a 5-point checklist.

## Building your own agent

```python
from cme.agent import AgentCapability, MeshAgent
from cme.protocol import CompressionStep, ConfidenceLevel, ExpansionStep

class LegalAgent(MeshAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="legal",
            capability=AgentCapability(
                domain="legal",
                produces=["contract_terms"],
                consumes=["risk_register"],
            ),
        )

    def expand(self, problem, context):
        return [
            ExpansionStep(label="Reframe", content="..."),
            ExpansionStep(label="Constraints", content="..."),
            # ...up to 6 steps
        ]

    def compress(self, problem, expansion, context):
        return (
            "final recommendation...",
            [CompressionStep(label="Integrate", content="...")],
            ConfidenceLevel.MEDIUM,
            "what would change this recommendation",
            {"contract_terms": {...}},  # structured output
        )
```

Drop the agent into `EnterpriseOrchestrator(agents=[...])` — the orchestrator discovers its `produces`/`consumes` capability and places it in the execution order automatically.

### Plugging in a real LLM

The framework is LLM-agnostic. Each agent's `expand` and `compress` are plain methods — call any model inside them. The protocol handles grounding checks, failure modes, playbook updates, and rendering regardless of what produces the reasoning.
